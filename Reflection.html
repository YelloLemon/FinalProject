<p>This was my first CIS class, and it was terrifying, intimidating, and frustrating at the same time. I first arrived in class and took the CIW knowledge exam the first week, receiving a poor grade. I only realized then that I knew nothing about site development and had a lot to learn. Mr. Kadwell was the instructor, and he guided and encouraged me throughout the course, allowing me to feel more confident about entering the field of web development. Because it had specific instructions and held my hand from point A to Z, it felt easy as I was leaning and doing the Labs. Until I finished this final project, I had no idea how many mistakes I'd made on my own. I can't remember a lot of things, like tags and closing tags. Using CSS has proven to be the most difficult aspect of my project. I couldn't seem to get a grip on it, and it took me hours to figure out what was wrong. I know I have a lot to learn and need to practice more. I'm excited for my next CIS class, and hopefully I'll be prepared!

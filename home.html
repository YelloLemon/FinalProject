<p>My name is Emma, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Web Development and Programming at the University of Phoenix. I am currently enrolled as a full-time student. I used to work as a technician for the Boeing Corporation. Last year, I left my job to travel and take some time to figure out where I wanted to go in life. I returned home with the realization that I needed a job that allowed me to work from anywhere in the world. I do not intend to travel once I reach retirement age; money can always be made, but my youth will never be reclaimed. I'm hoping to finish my degree as soon as possible and move on with my life! Thank you for taking the time to look at my page!

<h3>Tennis</h3>
	<p> 
	I'm in love with it. Many of my closest friends are individuals I've met via tennis, and I consider it a major part of my life. An enjoyable pastime that can be enjoyed for the rest of your life. I've played with individuals in their 80s and 90s. Both sexes are welcome to join in on the fun and competition. For families, it's a terrific option. It's a great way to stay in shape. Playing the game at a high level is straightforward, but mastering it is a little trickier. Everyone may join in the fun.
<br>
<br>
	It's a terrific way to deal with stress. It's not only the strokes itself that have an influence on your game; strategy and court location are just as important.

<h3>Hiking</h3>

	<p>Hiking is a great way to relax. Why? Nature. We can't live without nature. Even though it seems outlandish in today's digital age, it's true. There is no place like a mountaintop tarn or a valley that is completely isolated from the rest of the world to discover peace and quiet. This is the only thing in the world that serves as a compass for me.
<br>
<br>
	You'll be able to see things you never thought imaginable. There are icicles that are higher than persons that flow upstream due of the strong wind. It's amazing what the clouds can achieve. Have you ever had the opportunity to see the clouds from the air? When you're able to go about and explore above the clouds on your own two feet, it's a whole other experience.

<h3>Traveling</h3>
	<p>Travelling interests me more than any other thing would ever do. It is the best form of learning. To imbibe the new culture, to know it's people, to understand the diversity, to explore the places you never knew, stories you never heard, history you were unaware of, geography you learn to cope up with, the way they lived, the way they are living, to know not only about the place but also it's people. It is like a human library at a different place. Every time you visit a new place, it is like you leave a part of your heart in that place and you live a part of the place in your heart.

<br>
<br>
	Travelling gives you the experience and teaches you life like nothing else can, nothing else ever did. Best part is the FOOD!

<h3>Me & Doggo</h3>
	<p>Animals have a particular place in my heart, especially those that I own. That's because they're all in it for the love. For whatever reason, they live from a place of love that we must endeavor to return to. Our culture teaches us otherwise as we get older, which makes us more difficult to understand and perhaps hazardous to others around us on an emotional level (sometimes). Animals maintain the space for us to develop into what we need to reclaim, to be entire. Whenever we need a push in the right direction, they are there to give us a kiss, stop the negativity, show us the path, and make us remember what it feels like to be loved completely and completely. As a result, there are so many books on animal encounters because it is difficult to convey the breadth of knowledge that all of that covers in objective words.
